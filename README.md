I have coded in python and used PYCHARM software. To run the program: I have used the packages called 
"pip install pytorch"


import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.datasets as dsets
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
